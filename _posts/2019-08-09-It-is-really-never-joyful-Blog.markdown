If we give it a little thought, we will find that neither Einstein, Jim Carrey or Messi have total fun while doing their jobs and enjoy every minute of it (be it science, art or sports). They feel pain and laziness and curse a lot when they had to wake up everyday early to do their tasks. Nobody prefers working on his own project over a sunny day on the beach or watching a movie. They prefer something else, we will come to it later.

What really differs those guys from the rest us is not high IQ or talent, but only their discipline and commitment to what they intend to do and aim to reach.

Some moments bring fun with them, but only at the end, and that is why we endure and tolerate the pain and boredom of work, only looking forward to the fun and joyful moments at the end, after we deliver the project or see the output we were seeking.

If God blesses me with children, one of the very first lessons is to learn discipline and commitment to long-term goals and plans and not to stick to instantaneous gratification and pleasure. It has already been proved with millions of examples, the more you endure at the moment and be disciplined to, the happier you are and more gain and succeed you receive.

It might be really boring and irritating every weekend to go a language course to learn a foreign language, but it totally pays off when you go to a job interview and then you go out saying to yourself "I nailed it!" then you are offered the job in spite of your shitty language skills. When you look back, you'll never remember how many Friday parties you have missed and how many nights you had to sleep early or do your homework for the language teacher. You'll never remember your embarrassment when you were trying to order a coffee with language of a 4-year old child, but you'll only remember the moment when you finished a phone call with an official successfully and you didn't understand anything but you nailed it as well!

It also is very difficult to commit to doing sports 3 times a week, but after doing it for 1 year and losing what you wanted to lose or building whatever you wanted to built, you will forget the sad and painful moments of the workout and be happy with the end result.

If I would say I have learnt only one lesson in life, it would be that:
### Success is boring, painful. It is never fun and exciting

This shitty motivational speakers who would say "follow your passion, you are great, you can do it. Success is easy, all I have to do is to intend and plan to do it". I would say only "Go to hell". You only raised the hopes of hopeless people whom you made think that success is easy and just a piece of cake, but actually it didn't work and they failed more than ever and were depressed deeper than before.

It is totally fine to be average, to be just OK. Not all of us has to be successful, popular, has his own personal brand or be the one and only one in his own area. It is ok to be normal. Don't over stress yourself about it. We have to accept the fact that we are totally fine like that!
