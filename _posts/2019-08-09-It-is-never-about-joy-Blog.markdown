# It is really never joyful

If we give it a little thought, we will find that neither Einstein, Jim Carrey or Messi have total fun while doing their jobs and enjoy every minute of it (be it science, art or sports). They feel pain and laziness and curse a lot when they had to wake up everyday early to do their tasks. Nobody prefers working on his own project over a sunny day on the beach or watching a movie. They prefer something else, we will come to it later.

What really differs those guys from the rest us is not high IQ or talent, but only their discipline and commitment to what they intend to do and aim to reach

Some moments bring fun with them, and that is why we endure and tolerate the pain and boredom of work, only looking forward to the fun and joyful moments at the end, after we deliver the project or see the output we were seeking.

If God blesses me with children, one of the very first lessons is to learn discipline and commitment to long-term goals and plans and not to stick to instantaneous gratification and pleasure. It has already been proved with millions of examples, the more you endure now and be disciplined to, the more you gain and succeed.

It might be really boring and irritating every weekend to go the school to learn a foreign language, but it totally pays off when you go to a job interview and then you go out saying to yourself "I nailed it!" then you are offered the job in spite of your shitty language skills. When you look back, you'll never remember how many Friday parties you have missed and how many nights you had to sleep early or do your homework for the language teacher. You'll never remember your embarrassment when you were trying to order a coffee with language of a 4-year old child, but you'll only remember the moment when you finished a phone call with an official successfully and you didn't understand anything but you nailed it as well!

## The moments of the thesis

More than two and half years, I was offered a job to do my master thesis in a company in a field where I literally have no idea of! I didn't know till now what they saw in my resume and my skills to let them think I would be a fit for such job, but anyways, I was offered it.

It was really hard thinking about it! but at those moments I see only one thing: I am challenged out of my comfort zone!! what would the worst thing to happen? I won't be killed anyways. So my decision was to get! If I did it well it will be something that really counts, new experience, big company, new country! hell lot of new challenges!

Months passed and it is my first day of job, my supervisor told me some introductory points, gave me some documents to read, showed me where are the files on the network and went to do his job. In this period he was really busy and most of the time was out of office. I started skimming through the documents, doing some software tutorials, reading some papers and it was fun and I enjoyed it, for only few days! After couple of weeks, the other students started to really get deep in their projects, doing complex stuff, getting results that maybe included in their master theses, and I was still doing tutorials. I was already worried so I talked with senior colleagues and did my own investigations to find out that was one of ways my supervisor used to deal with the interns, 'LET THEM ON THEIR OWN'!

I was really scared, I have only 6 months, and already one has passed (16.67%)! This was one of the moments of enlightenment that told me: it is now my turn to do it on my own. I worked really harder to figure it out on my own (with the help of colleagues and of course the support of the supervisor) till I felt that I am on solid ground to really start doing my job.

Weeks passed and I did a good job. I learned a lot out of my field, developed a numerical optimization framework and applied it in a project where my work was implemented and realized, took part in a lot of meetings and presentations where my results drove the research and development decisions in the project. These were the moments that I meant before and what I really remember and re-live, not the moments of cursing and feeling confused and irritated.

It was only because of one thing that I had in front of my eyes: discipline and commitment to a long-term goal, which is totally out of my comfort zone.
